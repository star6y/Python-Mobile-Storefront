# Web-Phone-shop
A website for an imaginary phone shop.

There are three pages available to customers, and one admin page. Customers can send orders. On the admin page, we can see these orders along with the customer's contact info. We can delete contacts and start/end a sale.

The server is written in Python. There are some APIs to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests, all implemented in JavaScript.
